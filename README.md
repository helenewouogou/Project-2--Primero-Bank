Project 2: Visualize Data with Excel
Client: Primero Bank
Context and Mission Challenges:

The mission is commissioned by Primero Bank, a 100% online bank that has been in existence for 5 years. It offers common banking operations similar to traditional banks, with the sole difference being the absence of physical branches.

Identifying among the current clients, the profiles that might leave.
